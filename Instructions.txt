I. How to get the software working on your computer:

1) get a webcam, and install it's drivers onto your computer.

2) download the Arduino IDE (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) .

3) download the Processing IDE (http://processing.org/download/) .

4) download the folloring libraries: JMyron, blobDetection, and controlP5 (http://processing.org/reference/libraries/).

5) download the most recent sentry gun code for Arduino and Processing (http://code.google.com/p/airsoft-sentry-gun/downloads/list).

6) Connect your servo's to your Arduino, as explained below. 

7) Open the Arduino IDE, and then within it, open the sentry gun code for the Arduino.

8) Plug the Arduino into your computer.

9) program the Arduino by clicking the 'compile' button, then the 'upload' button. If you get any errors, check that your board is selected by going to Tools > Board, and that the right COM port is selected by going to Tools > Serial Port.

10) Now, open the Processing IDE, and within it, open the sentry gun code for Processing.

11) Run the code by pressing 'Ctrl + r'  or clicking "Run".







II. How to connect the servos: 

1) Place the arduino board with the silver serial/USB port on the top. There should be a vertical row of black sockets down each side of the board. The ATMega chip should be vertical, on the lower left-hand side of the board. 

2) The sockets down the right side of the board are the digital I/O pins. They are numbered 0 to 13. 

3) On the left side are more sockets. You will only use the Gnd (ground) pin on this side. 


4) Wire the ground (black wire) of your servo power source to the 'Gnd' pin on the Arduino board.

5) For each of your servo's, wire the black/brown wire to the 'Gnd' pin on the Arduino board.

6) For each of your servo's, wire the red wire to the power (red wire) of your servo power source.

7) Wire each servo's yellow/white wire to it's own pin on the right side of the board, as designated at the beginning of the sentry gun code for Arduino.

8) Connect other LED's and/or switches as preferred. This is outlined at the beginning of the sentry gun code for Arduino. These are optional.




III. Troubleshooting:

Don't know if the porblem is with the Arduino or the computer? Download and run the Targeting Demo. If it doesn't run, the problem is with the computer.

Are all the libraries downloaded and working?

Are your webcam drivers downloaded and working?

Is your Arduino plugged in, and are the right Serial Port and Board selected?

If you run the code and get this error: "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0" then change this line in the code: arduinoPort = new Serial(this, Serial.list()[0], 9600); to arduinoPort = new Serial(this, Serial.list()[1], 9600); or arduinoPort = new Serial(this, Serial.list()[2], 9600); .
